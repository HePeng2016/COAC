# compile

     make

When 'make' command is fininshed,'FeatureGen' and 'Cluster' files are generated.    

# config file 
  The parameters for procedure are recorded in config file. 
  
The content of config file:
    
    Tolerance = 0.000001
    CutOff = 0.20
    ZeroTolerance = 0.03
    MaxDepth =  1024
    MinSupport = 3

Tolerance:

   ![first equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Csigma%20_%7Bi%7D) is an eigen value of matrix.  
   
   If Tolerance is specified, threshold = 1-Tolerance; The procedure will find the maxmum r which satisfy  
   ![first equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Csigma%20_%7B1%7D%5E%7B2%7D&plus;%5Csigma%20_%7B2%7D%5E%7B2%7D&plus;%5Csigma%20_%7B3%7D%5E%7B2%7D%20...%20&plus;%5Csigma%20_%7Br%7D%5E%7B2%7D%7D%7B%5Csigma%20_%7B1%7D%5E%7B2%7D&plus;%5Csigma%20_%7B2%7D%5E%7B2%7D&plus;%5Csigma%20_%7B3%7D%5E%7B2%7D%20...%20&plus;%5Csigma%20_%7Bn%7D%5E%7B2%7D%7D%5Cleq%20threshold).Then the first r principal components are selected. 
 
CutOff: 
   
   There a F-distribution for all attribute values in a component.The P-value of each selected attribute caculated by F-distribution must be smaller than CutOff. So the number of selected attribute in each component is depended on CutOff. Smaller CutOff can shrink the number of final result.If the number of result exponentially expand too large,the CutOff should be tuned smaller.
   
MaxDepth:

   The maximum number of principal components of Attribute Clustering. 

MinSupport:

   The minmum size of Attribute Clustering.The bigger MinSupport will introduce smaller the number of final result.
   
   
# Comands

    ./Cluster TestMatrix   OutFile   [ FilterFile ] 
    
The config file is necessary that exist in the same directory with data file. if not,the path of config file must be specified.

    ./Cluster TestMatrix  OutFile  [ FilterFile ]  -config   configPATH/config 
    
'FilterFile' is optional, the column name which not be contained in this file will be ignored,the format of the 'FilterFile' is described as follow: 

    column_name1
    column_name2
    ...
    column_namen
         
'TestMatrix' is the input file, the format of the input file is described as follow: 
       
       column_name1  column_name2  column_name3  column_name4 ...
        0.12         0.11           0.34          0.98        ...
        ... 
  
 'OutFile' is output file name. 
 
        grep CorrelationAverage OutFile > log 
  
 After above command is executed,the content of log file is described as following: 
 
        CorrelationAverage: 3 0.999124 0.148882
        CorrelationAverage: 3 0.989092 0.142556
        ......
  The first column numeric indicate the number of elements in each clustering.The second column numeric indicate Average correlation of this clustering and the third column numeric indicate Average Component Ratio of this clustering.  
  The  distribution of Average correlation and Average Component Ratio can be obtained from log file,The thresholds of Average correlation and Average Component Ratio for filtration are evaluated from this distribution. 
 
      
     FeatureGen ToFeature   InputFile OutputFile AverageCorrelation AverageComponentRatio
 
 'ToFeature' is the keyword. InputFile is the filename of Cluster commond generated file.  OutputFile is output file name for features record.AverageCorrelation is a numeric indicate the threshold of Average correlation and AverageComponentRatio is a  numeric indicate the threshold of Average Component Ratio.  
 
    FeatureGen Decipher FeatureFile   InputFile OutputFile
   
  'Decipher' is the keyword,FeatureFile is the filename of 'FeatureGen ToFeature' commond generated file.InputFile is a matrix file with the same format with the input file of 'Cluster' command, OutputFile is the filename of a sparse matrix which is a mapping of outputfile. This mapping is implemented using features which recorded in FeatureFile.The OutputFile with sparse matrix format can be loaded into R environment directly for further analysis.
